<li>HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</li>
</ol>
<p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).

<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<ol start="8">

</ol>
<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</li>
</ol>
<p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:&#x75;&#110;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#x61;&#112;&#x70;&#x2e;&#x74;&#101;&#97;&#x6d;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x75;&#110;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#x61;&#112;&#x70;&#x2e;&#x74;&#101;&#97;&#x6d;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.</p>
<ol start="10">

</ol>
<p>In Short: In some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
<p>In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

<ol start="11">
<li>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</li>
</ol>
<p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated &quot;Revised&quot; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
